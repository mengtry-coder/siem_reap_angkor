Angkor Wat had a city of more than 1 million inhabitants surrounding it at the height of the Khmer Empire.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Originally built as a Hindu Temple dedicated to Vishnu,&nbsp; it was converted to a Buddhist Temple by Jayavarman VII after Angkor was sacked by the Cham people in 1177.&nbsp; Unusually for Temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the West, there are several explanations for this, the most likely being is that Vishnu is associated with the Western Cardinal Point.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">This massive stone temple actually floats, the moat ensures it doesn&rsquo;t sink.&nbsp; The water table in this part of Cambodia is close to the ground surface and the monsoon climate means the ground dries out and shrinks in the dry season as the water table lowers. The moat around the temple keeps the subsurface from drying out, holding the water table in place and preventing the temple sinking during the dry season. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Angkor Wat was built without using mortar, a vegetable gum was used instead. To ensure the blocks fit together seamlessly they were rubbed against each other until friction wore the surfaces down to a perfect fit. The Khmer were amazing hydro engineers; they would have impressed the Romans.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Despite all of this, the temple was never completed, and you can see the evidence of this if you look closely.&nbsp; The engraved bases of the columns aren&rsquo;t all completed and some of the bas relief shows where the sculptors intended to carve additional characters which weren&rsquo;t completed.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Angkor Wat also displays layers of military and political history in the graffiti etched into its walls. The oldest graffiti is thought to be left by the conquering Cham Army in 1177. If you look closely you will find graffiti from the French Colonial period, Japanese occupation in WW2, Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese graffiti as well as UNTAC and some modern tourists.&nbsp; Other graffiti and engravings are also carved into the walls, many of them amateur attempts to copy other symbols and carvings, leaving the observer to ponder who may have made these etchings. </span></span></p>\r\n', NULL, 1, '2020-04-16 09:17:49', 1, '2020-04-22 09:30:12', 1);

He also celebrated his victory in a large bas relief carved into his state temple, the Bayon which dominates the centre of his city.&nbsp; All the bridges over the moats are carved with protective symbols of the Nagas,&nbsp; Asuras and demons in the eternal &ldquo;Churning of the Sea of Milk&rdquo;.&nbsp; The warrior god Indra, the King of the celestial beings is a protector of the city, assisted by Lokeshvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion, carved into the towers over the gates watching protectively out in all directions. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The city had a grand &ldquo;Victory Avenue&rdquo; leading from the Victory Gate to the Royal &ldquo;Victory Square&rdquo; where the Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King provided the stage for the Court to receive parades and conduct celebrations.

For example, Angkor Wat is a state temple, but Banteay Srei is not. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Construction materials</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Only temples were built with nonperishable materials, as the Gods live forever.&nbsp; The earliest temples are built of brick. This is a carryover from the method of temple construction employed by the Chenla, the immediate predecessor to the Khmer Empire. &nbsp;No mortar was used in brick temples, instead a vegetable gum was used to bond the bricks, this gave an almost invisible join and made it possible to carve the brickwork. Sometimes the brickwork was carved directly and other temples had stucco facing which was carved instead. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Laterite, an easy stone to work, but with an unattractive appearance was used for foundations and massive features. It is an iron rich clay that hardens when exposed to the air and sun.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Sandstone began to be used around the 10th century and eventually all temples were built of laterite and sandstone. Sandstone is wonderful material to carve, but it tends to flake eventually. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Religion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Until King Jayavarman VII, the Khmer Empire was Hindu and all temples were built to honour Hindu Gods, most notably, Vishnu and Shiva.&nbsp; King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181-1218) was a Mahayana Buddhist, and the most prolific builder of all the Khmer Kings, many of his Buddhist temples survive. However, the Empire converted back to Hinduism later and Buddhist icons were defaced.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Telling your Prasats from your Banteays</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The names in use for the Temples are modern, and you may notice several words used repeatedly.

It was huge; at its largest extent Funan covered most of SE Asia, from the Bay of Bengal to the South China Sea at central Vietnam, and south to almost the tip of the Malay Peninsula. Archaeological evidence indicated that the population of Funan, in the Cambodian region was Khmer, although it was heavily influenced by India especially in the 4th and 5th centuries. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Funan reached the apex of its power under the 3rd century king Fan Shiman who expanded his empire&#39;s navy and improved bureaucracy that left local customs and identities largely intact, particularly in the empire&#39;s further reaches. Fan Shiman and his successors also sent ambassadors to China and India to regulate sea trade. The Funanese established a strong system of mercantilism and commercial monopolies that would become a pattern for empires in the region. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Funan was supplanted and absorbed in the 6th century by the&nbsp;Khmer&nbsp;Kambuja Kingdom, better known as Chenla, or Zhenla in Chinese. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Chenla (Kambuja)</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The Chenla were Khmer and their name for their society was Kambuja. They first appear in the Chinese Chronicles as a Funan&#39;s vassal state which gained its independence around 550 A.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 60 years, Chenla conquered Funan, absorbed its people and culture. The royal families of Chenla intermarried with their Funanese counterparts and generally preserved the earlier political, social, and religious institutions. Once they established control they embarked on a course of conquest that continued from the 6th until the 9th centuries. They subjugated central and upper Laos, annexed portions of the Mekong Delta, and brought what are now western Cambodia and southern Thailand under their direct control. The first capital of Chenla, named Isanapura, was established around 613 A.D. in Kompong Thom province.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">What we know about the civilisation comes from Chinese writings, the remaining Chenla temple architecture and stone inscriptions.&nbsp; The stone inscriptions are the first recorded local writing and they were made in both Sanskrit and Khmer.&nbsp; The first princes that are recorded are in a Sanskrit inscription at Stung Treng&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:white\">province; </span>a ruler Vīravarman and his father Sārvabhauma.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The significance of this inscription is that it indicates a change of culture under the influence of Hinduism. <span style=\"background-color:white\">Adoption of the idea of the Hindu state with its consecrated military leader, the &quot;Varman&quot; as a protector king was the basis for control and legitimacy. The Hindu religion was alluring as it offered the benefits of royal ideology with no political strings attached.&nbsp;Viravarman&rsquo;s successors continued this traditional correlation between political and religious authority. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Factional disputes in the court resulted in the splitting of the kingdom in 706 into Land Chenla (Upper Chenla) and Water Chenla (Lower Chenla).&nbsp; In 715, both Chenla states were further broken up into several smaller states.&nbsp; Upper Chenla, with its capital in the Champassak province of modern Laos, was a somewhat centralized state with 30 provincial headquarters operating as administrative centers. Lower Chenla, occupying the former Funan kingdom along the Mekong Delta and the coast, had a turbulent existence with constant pirate raids from Java, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. The last of the Water Chenla kings allegedly was killed around A.D. 790. A prince from Sambhpura, Java, took the reins as a puppet ruler.

The water management network depended on elaborate configurations of channels, ponds, and embankments and was the key to the Empire&rsquo;s prosperity for half a millennium. By freeing cultivators from dependence on unreliable seasonal monsoons, they made possible an early &quot;green revolution&quot; that provided the country with large surpluses of rice.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Suryavarman II (1113-50), one of the greatest of the Khmer Empire monarchs, expanded his kingdom&#39;s territory in a series of successful wars against the kingdom of Champa in central Vietnam, the kingdom of Nam Viet in northern Vietnam, and the small Mon states of Myanmar. He reduced to vassalage the Thai peoples and established his suzerainty over the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. His greatest achievement was the construction of Angkor Wat. Suryavarman II&#39;s reign was followed, however, by thirty years of dynastic upheaval and an invasion by the neighboring Cham, who sacked the city of Angkor in 1177.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181&ndash;1219) is generally considered to be the Khmer Empire&rsquo;s greatest King. He begins his reign by defeating the&nbsp;Champa&nbsp;in a successful campaign. Unlike his predecessors, who had adopted the cult of the Hindu god-king, Jayavarman VII was a fervent patron of Mahayana Buddhism. Casting himself as a bodhisattva, he embarked on a frenzy of building activity that included the Angkor Thom complex and the Bayon, a remarkable temple whose stone towers depict 216 faces of Buddha. Further outstanding works are attributed to him &ndash;&nbsp;Banteay Kdei,&nbsp;Ta Prohm,&nbsp;Neak Pean&nbsp;and Sra Srang. The construction of an impressive number of utilitarian and secular projects and edifices, such as maintenance of the extensive road network, in particular the royal road to&nbsp;Phimai&nbsp;and the many rest houses, bridges and hospitals. After Jayavarman VII&#39;s death in 1219, the Khmer Empire entered a long period of decline. &nbsp;Two droughts which both lasted decades interspersed with massive flooding, the change of religion, and the threat from Siam were eventually too much for the Empire. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">In 1353 the Siamese army captured Angkor, as well as looting the city they carried off thousands of talented and skilled Khmer back to Siam. It was recaptured by the Khmer, but wars continued and the capital was looted several times. During the same period, Khmer territory north of the present Laos border was lost to the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. In 1431 the Siamese captured Angkor, and the Capital was moved south.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Angkor was the largest pre-industrial city in the world with a population of over 1 million and<span style=\"background-color:white\"> an elaborate infrastructure system connecting an urban sprawl of at least 1,000 square kilometers to the well-known temples at its core. </span>The combination of sophisticated wet-rice agriculture, based on an engineered irrigation system and the&nbsp;Tonle Sap&#39;s spectacular abundance in fish and aquatic fauna, guaranteed a regular food surplus. <span style=\"background-color:white\">Angkor was a megacity supporting at least 0.1% of the global population from the 11th to the </span>13th centuries.

As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and&nbsp;South Vietnam&nbsp;became concerned and the United States began bombing raids, contributing to destabilisation. Prince Sihanouk, fearing that the conflict between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam might spill over to Cambodia, publicly opposed the idea of a bombing campaign by the United States along the Vietnam&ndash;Cambodia border and inside Cambodian territory. Prince Sihanouk wanted Cambodia to stay out of the North Vietnam&ndash;South Vietnam conflict and was very critical of the United States government and its allies (the South Vietnamese government).

The new regime immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Hanoi rejected the new republic&#39;s request for the withdrawal of troops. In response, the United States provided assistance to the new government&#39;s armed forces, which were engaged against both Khmer Rouge insurgents and North Vietnamese forces. The North Vietnamese immediately launched armed attacks on the new government and quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching to within 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) of&nbsp;Phnom Penh. Then they turned the newly won territories over to the&nbsp;Khmer Rouge. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">In April 1970, US President Richard Nixon announced that USA and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia.&nbsp; Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">The Khmer Rouge insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. However, the Khmer Rouge became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, they were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia&#39;s territory and 25% of its population. More than two million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">The US intervention and bombing campaign was a significant factor leading to increased support of the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry. The Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia, launched at the request of the Khmer Rouge, has also been cited as a major factor in their eventual victory. &nbsp;Vietnam later admitted that it played a decisive role in their seizure of power. China armed and trained the Khmer Rouge during the civil war and continued to aid them years afterward.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', NULL, 1, '2020-04-16 10:54:56', 1, '2020-04-22 09:34:57', 1);

Immediately after its victory, they ordered the evacuation of all cities and towns, sending the entire urban population into the countryside to work as farmers. Agriculture was collectivised, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system. Religion was banned and Wats used as pigsties, ammunition dumps and barracks, many temples were vandalized and looted. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">20,000 people died of exhaustion or disease during the evacuation of&nbsp;Phnom Penh&nbsp;and its aftermath. Those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed. Some of the ethnicities in Cambodia, such as the&nbsp;Cham&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vietnamese&nbsp;suffered specific and targeted and violent persecutions. &nbsp;People were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, absent for government assigned work, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough &#39;counter-revolutionaries&#39; to execute.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">When Cambodian socialists began to rebel in the eastern zone of Cambodia,&nbsp;Pol Pot&nbsp;ordered his armies to exterminate 1.5 million eastern Cambodians which he branded as &quot;Cambodians with Vietnamese minds&quot; in the area.&nbsp;The purge killed more than 250,000 Cambodians in just over a month.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">The Khmer Rouge relations with Vietnam and Thailand worsened rapidly as a result of border clashes.

The Khmer Rouge forces retreated rapidly to the jungles near the Thai border. The occupation gave rise to clashes between three major resistance groups &ndash; the FUNCINPEC (a royalist party), the KPLNF (Khmer People&rsquo;s National Liberation Front) and the Khmer Rouge.&nbsp; The resulting guerrilla war displaced hundreds of thousands of Cambodians, who fled to refugee camps along the border to Thailand and tens of thousands of people were murdered throughout the country. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Cambodia&rsquo;s humanitarian crisis continued as famine took hold and fighting continued. In one incident, 40 thousand Cambodian refugees were forced into a minefield on the Thai border, those who refused were shot. Over 3,000 people lost their life.

The Conference gave the UN full authority to supervise a cease-fire, repatriate the displaced Khmer along the border with Thailand, disarm and demobilise the factional armies, and prepare the country for free and fair elections.
